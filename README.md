Mapping utilities for understanding external headless CMS data.

## Release process
Once the changes are merged into the `main` branch. Always make sure,
you make a `tag` from the version. And always bump only the `patch` version.

Eg: 1.0.4 -> becomes 1.0.5

Since at the time of installation, the package managers pull the latest patch version available.
